## What's GGPO?

Traditional techniques account for network transmission time by adding delay to a players input, resulting in a sluggish, laggy game-feel.  Rollback networking uses input prediction and speculative execution to send player inputs to the game immediately, providing the illusion of a zero-latency network.  Using rollback, the same timings, reactions, visual and audio queues, and muscle memory your players build up playing offline will translate directly online.  The GGPO networking SDK is designed to make incorporating rollback networking into new and existing games as easy as possible.

This repository contains the code, documentation, and sample applications for the SDK.

Architecture and API internals are documented in
[`doc/architecture`](doc/architecture/README.md). Build, installation, and
application integration guidance is in the [Developer Guide](doc/DeveloperGuide.md).

## Building

The SDK currently supports Windows builds. Linux and Apple platform adapters are
documented follow-up work; unsupported SDK targets fail configuration explicitly.

### Windows

Windows builds require Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ workload, CMake, and
Python 3. The tested build, installation, package-consumption, and runtime
integration steps are in the [Developer Guide](doc/DeveloperGuide.md#install-the-sdk).

## Sample Application

The Vector War application in the source directory contains a simple application which uses GGPO to synchronize the two clients.  The command line arguments are:

```
vectorwar.exe  <localport>  <num players> ('local' | <remote ip>:<remote port>) for each player
```

See the .cmd files in the bin directory for examples on how to start 2, 3, and 4 player games.
